# DataBaseProject
We have created a camping booking system, which allows the owner to manage bookings, visitors and different kinds of accomodation.
We are using MySQL and an user interface in python as a foundation for the project.
All tables, queries, functions, triggers, procedures and views are created in mySQL.
We linked mySQL to python for creating a user interface where the user can easily add and delete booknings, accomodation objects and allows users to make queries of their own and and specify all of the above in detail via user input.
